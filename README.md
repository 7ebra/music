[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/owncloud/music.png)](http://travis-ci.org/owncloud/music)

**This is under heavy development and isn't supposed to be deployed to a production server!**

I want to see it live - but how?
--------------------------------

Requirements:

 * appframework > 0.103
 * ownCloud 5 or 6

Known bugs:

 * ugly play icons in IE8 [#62](https://github.com/owncloud/music/issues/62)
 * Ampache not working yet [#62](https://github.com/owncloud/music/issues/62)
 * maybe slow for large music collections [#62](https://github.com/owncloud/music/issues/62)

Happy testing!
