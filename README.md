**This is under heavy development and isn't supposed to be deployed to a production server!**

I want to see it live - but how?
--------------------------------

Requirements:

 * ownCloud 5+

Known bugs:

 * ugly play icons in IE8 [#62](https://github.com/owncloud/music/issues/62)
 * Ampache not working yet [#62](https://github.com/owncloud/music/issues/62)
 * maybe slow for large music collections [#62](https://github.com/owncloud/music/issues/62)

Happy testing!
